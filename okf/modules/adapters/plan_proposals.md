## Module docstring

~~~text
Offline plan proposer for the PlayIDE chat (ADR-0156): a bounded phrase grammar and the pack's modelled meanings,
never an LLM. Its plans are untrusted proposals like any other; the application re-checks every step.

A request is split into clauses ("then", ";", new lines). Each clause must be one complete phrase using exact model
names, for example "add state Archived after <state>" or "add <action> from <state> to Archived for <role>". A request that
matches none of the phrases is matched against the pack's proposal rules, and a supported meaning with transactions
becomes the plan. Anything else is refused with the phrases it understands.
